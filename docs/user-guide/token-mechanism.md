# Token Mechanism

The CodeChain network is operated by a two-token mechanism. CCS (CodeChain Stake) tokens represent the stake in the network and CCC (CodeChain Coin) tokens are used for the fees that the services based on the CodeChain network charge for transactions. In other words, service providers have to pay the fee tokens for transactions or any on-chain actions (e.g. vote) they generate.

## Total issuance of tokens on the CodeChain network

|              | Stake tokens (CCS)      | Fee Tokens(CCC)               |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Total supply | 10,000,000 (10 million) | 100,000,000,000 (100 billion) |

Since CCS and CCC are fixed in supply, inflation will not occur.

## CCC (CodeChain Coin)

CCC is used to pay for fees when using the CodeChain network, such as minting an asset token, transferring an issued asset token, etc. In other words, CCC is the currency of the CodeChain network transactions.

## CCS (CodeChain Stake)

Stake token holders are the owners of the network and have the following rights:

1. The right to participate in the network as a validator
1. The right to earn transaction fees paid to the network

Eligible candidates for purchasing CodeChain stake tokens would primarily be entities that use the CodeChain network for the services they provide.

## Transaction fees

The fees consist of _normal fees_, which are the minimum rates required for paying the transactions, and _express fees_, which are additional rates required for settling urgent transactions. The normal fees earned by the CodeChain network for keeping transactions records are then distributed to the stake token holders (stakeholders of the network) on a pro-rata basis, and the additional fees are allocated to the validators that have settled the incumbent transactions.

## Relationship between CCC and CCS

Fee tokens earned by the network are redistributed to the stake token holders on a pro-rata basis. For example, if we assume Kodebox holds 80% of the total stake tokens and 1,000 fee tokens are paid, Kodebox earns 800 fee tokens.
